                    <p>Being pretty self-taught as far as UI design goes, I’ve always wondered why so many articles and
                        books talk about color theory and palettes. In my experience, using a “split complementary
                        palette” is about 0% predictive of me making nice-looking designs.</p>
                    <p>I have another word for that sort of thing: <em>useless</em>.</p>
                    <p>So if color theory doesn’t provide a solid basis for color in UI design, what does?</p>
                    <p>Let me throw an opinion at ya’: color <em>modifications</em>. It’s the tweaking of color that
                        counts, not the picking of them from the color theory hat.</p>
                    <p>Or, said another way: The <strong>fundamental</strong> skill of coloring interface designs is
                        being able to <strong>modify</strong> one base color into <strong>many different
                            variations</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I know this sounds a little odd. Hear me out. I’m going to give you a framework for adjusting
                        color in your UI designs.</p>
                    <p>This framework will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow you to modify <strong>one theme color</strong> for basically any purpose in your UI
                            (this is hugely powerful, and, as we’ll see, what apps like facebook are already doing)
                        </li>
                        <li>Help you to <strong>predict what color changes will look <em>good</em></strong></li>
                        <li>Make color seem <strong>less subjective</strong> (“subjective” is often a word for “I
                            haven’t figured out how it works” — and it’s a word you hear a <em>ton</em> when folks talk
                            about color)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Are we cool? We’re cool?</p>
                    <p>Great.</p>
                    <h1>Darker &amp; Lighter Variations</h1>
                    <p>One thing I’ve noticed across many great-looking interfaces is that they often have darker and
                        lighter variations on a particular theme color.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/896/1*Zebb-f-ULEc9Ii113ksa5Q.png" width="448"

                    </figure>
                    <p>You didn’t think that search bar was just a translucent black overlay, did you? Spoiler alert:
                        it’s not. No opacity of black overlaid on that blue will give you the color of the search bar.
                        It’s a variation picked by some other magic.</p>
                    <p>Quick, now look at Swell Grid, the beautiful surf forecast app.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Sha-BAM. We just got hit with a boatload of variations. How many are there? Go to the <a
                            href="http://swellgrid.com/australia/north-coast-nsw" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener nofollow">website</a> and count ’em yourself. Practically everything on this
                        page is a variation of the initial blue.</p>
                    <p>Or, here’s another simple example:</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/910/1*Vfetyb93BWZbrbhjcoFCjQ.png" width="455"

                    </figure>
                    <p>Even element <em>states</em> are variations on a color. This isn’t best described as “a palette
                        of 3 blues”. It’s one blue with variations.</p>
                    <p>But this begs the question: <em>how do you actually </em><strong><em>modify</em></strong><em> a
                        color to get good variations?</em></p>
                    <p>We’ll get there, but I want you to understand this stuff from the ground-up. So here are our 2
                        trusty principles for figuring this stuff out:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We’ll look to the <strong>real world for reference cues</strong>. Even though our interfaces
                            are “fake”, we still copy like mad from the real world, because after decades of seeing
                            things in the real world, we just <em>expect</em> light and color to <a target="_blank"

                        </li>
                        <li>We’ll use the <strong>HSB color system</strong>. The short of it is: it’s the most intuitive
                            color system with broad usage (for my purposes, Sketch and Photoshop). If you don’t know
                            what hue, saturation, and brightness are, let’s <a

                    <p>Alright, look around you. What “color variation” are you undoubtedly seeing two dozen instances
                        of every time you glance around your room?</p>
                    <p><em>Shadows.</em></p>
                    <p>You can think of a shadow as a darker variation on a base color.</p>

                        when a shadow falls on our coral wall.</p>

                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*QMAZ0jrMtHRF_GdgQ5h9sQ.png" width="414"

                    </figure>
                    <p>Alright, now we can compare and contrast. Notice a pattern?</p>
                    <p>When there’s a shadowed variation of a color, you can expect <em>brightness</em> to go
                        <em>down</em> and <em>saturation</em> to go <em>up</em>. We just looked at this in two
                        instances, but <strong>as far as I’ve ever seen, it’s a solid rule you can go by</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Now hue is a bit crazier — it went <em>down</em> for the coral wall shadow, and <em>up</em> for
                        the teal wall shadow. There <em>is</em> an explanation for that, but it’s much less important
                        and a bit more esoteric than saturation/brightness — so we’ll come back to hue later.</p>
                    <h1>The Rules</h1>
                    <p>Let’s unpack these concepts a bit more.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Darker color variation = higher saturation + lower brightness</strong></h2>
                    <p>If you look back to our facebook search bar example, you’ll see that’s exactly what’s going
                        on.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*ooNBwTBKu1PZ8vz9U3bHyw.png" width="414"
                                  height="128" role="presentation"></div>
                        <figcaption>The hue moves 1° out of 360°, which is practically a rounding error.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The saturation went up as the brightness went down. The reason the search bar couldn’t be an
                        opacity of black overlaid on the base blue is because, in HSB, <em>adding black</em> is
                        equivalent to <em>reducing brightness</em>. Instead, we want to reduce brightness <em>while
                            simultaneously adding saturation</em>. Black doesn’t add any saturation to our color!</p>
                    <p>Why, in the real world, are darker colors correlated with higher saturations? I haven’t the
                        slightest idea. But I can always make something up: <em>it’s because as the intensity of the
                            light (brightness) overtakes intensity of color (saturation), the color necessarily becomes
                            more washed out — and vice versa.</em></p>
                    <p>That might be complete BS, but it <em>kind of </em>makes sense, right?</p>
                    <h2>Lighter Color Variation = lower saturation + higher brightness</h2>
                    <p>Now, being the discerning and erudite readers that you are, you probably guessed that the
                        opposite transform that gives us <em>darker variations</em> will give us <em>lighter
                            variations</em>.</p>
                    <p>And you nailed it, by golly.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we can go one step further. If we go on lowering saturation and raising brightness
                        till the cows come home, where do we end up?</p>
                    <p>Here:</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/256/1*k8oOsCUdscEQT_EaMxnqag.png" width="128"
                                  height="128" role="presentation"></div>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We end up at white.</p>
                    <p>You can think of <em>making lighter variations</em> as <em>adding white</em>. And there are two
                        very simple ways to <em>add white </em>to a color in Sketch et al:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Reduce the opacity of the element (if it’s on a white background)</li>
                        <li>Add a translucent layer of white on top of the element</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>The Most Important Thing</h2>
                    <p>If you remember only one thing from this article, remember this:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            <mark>Darker color variations are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation.
                                Brighter color variations are made by increasing brightness and lowering saturation.
                            </mark>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>With this simple idea, you will be able to do amazing things with just a single color.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, so many variations in color between elements — or even states of the same element —
                        are just simple color modifications.</p>

                    <p>To be fair, not every design follows this rule 100% of the time. In the Harvest header above, the
                        selected state is <em>just</em> a lower brightness (saturation unchanged) and the hover state is
                        <em>just</em> a lower saturation (brightness unchanged). But we’ve looked at how color works in
                        the real world, and we know that why these designs look good is because they
                        <em>approximate</em> the principles laid out here.</p>
                    <h1>What About Hue?</h1>
                    <p>Speaking of <em>approximating the principles laid out here</em>, we should talk about hue. I said
                        it above too, but it bears repeating: hue is so secondary to the whole <em>saturation-and-brightness-move-in-opposite-directions </em>thing
                        that you can often just ignore it entirely when making color adjustments.</p>
                    <p>That being said, here’s the briefest of explanations.</p>
                    <p>First of all, each color has a sort of “perceived brightness” to it. This is called <em>luminosity</em>.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Even though this blue and this yellow are both at 100% HSB brightness, which <em>appears</em>
                        brighter?</p>
                    <p>I mean, like, ask anyone off the street: <em>which is brighter?</em></p>
                    <p>“Um. Yellow. Yellow?”</p>
                    <p>Thanks, rando. You just discovered luminosity.</p>
                    <p>“So I’m right?”</p>
                    <p>Yes, yes you are. Even if you hold brightness and saturation constant, and <em>just vary
                        hues</em>, you will get a <em>range of luminosities</em>, or perceived brightnesses, which we
                        measure in values between 0 and 100.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">

                    </figure>
                    <p>These are our hues in 30° intervals, all at 100% saturation and 100% brightness.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/478/1*c0A-5JQqtIVjDsI4R3rzGQ.png" width="239"

                    </figure>
                    <p>And <em>here </em>are our hues duplicated, put into Luminosity blend mode (on a white background
                        — that’s critical to add if you’re following along in Sketch), and overlaid with the brightness
                        of the resulting gray. This gives us a measure of the luminosity of the original color.</p>
                    <p>In Luminosity blend mode, a <em>bright gray</em> means <em>high luminosity</em>, and a <em>dark
                        gray</em> means <em>low luminosity</em>. If you think about it for a second, this makes perfect
                        sense.</p>
                    <p>Now, I’ve printed the numbers out for you, but chart’s worth a thousand numbers, right?</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/940/1*Ae52-cwRfQ1lTW1JAXZFow.png" width="470"
                                  height="237" role="presentation"></div>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Look, Sherlock, a pattern.</p>
                    <p>And this particular pattern answers our question from above. Remember how we saw that sometimes,
                        for a shadow, hue would shift <em>down</em> and sometimes it would shift <em>up</em>? Why does
                        it do that?</p>
                    <p>Well, first, notice that this graph has three maximum points and three minimum points. The
                        low-points are red, green, and blue. The high-points are cyan, magenta, and yellow.</p>
                    <p>Does these particular colors ring a bell? Yes. RGB and CMY are popular color systems, but
                        <strong>ignore that for now</strong>, because it’s leading you astray.</p>
                    <p>The important bit is this: if you don’t count saturation and brightness, shifting hue towards red
                        (0°), green (120°), or blue (240°) will <strong>decrease</strong> the luminosity, or perceived
                        lightness of the color. And shifting the hue towards yellow (60°), cyan (180°), or magenta
                        (300°) will <strong>increase</strong> the perceived lightness of the color.</p>
                    <p>The trick is to just <strong>make the movement of the hue match up with the movement of the
                        saturation and brightness</strong>. If you want a darker variation, move the hue towards red
                        (0°), green (120°), or blue (240°), whichever is closest — and vice versa (with cyan, magenta,
                        and yellow) for lighter variations. (Of course, this assumes you’re also lowering brightness and
                        increasing saturation)</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">
                        <div><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*6zipl9z4CQD-Tm2VItC78g.png" width="414"

                    </figure>
                    <p>That’s why the shadow on the coral wall shifted <em>down</em> in hue — it was shifting towards
                        red, at 0°, which is the nearest minimum point to 21°.</p>
                    <figure class="paragraph-image">

                    </figure>
                    <p>And that’s why the shadow on the teal wall shifted <em>up</em> in hue — it was shifting towards
                        blue, at 240°, which is the nearest minimum point to 194°.</p>
                    <p>Mind blown yet?</p>
                    <h1>The Way of Color</h1>
                    <p>So when it comes to color variations, ask yourself: do I need simply a lighter or darker
                        variation on a color I already have?</p>
                    <p>(And if you’re going for something clean and simple, the answer is so, so often <em>yes</em>)</p>
                    <p><strong>Darker variations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brightness decreases</li>
                        <li>Saturation increases</li>
                        <li>Hue (often) shifts towards a luminosity minimum (red, green, or blue)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Lighter variations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brightness increases</li>
                        <li>Saturation decreases</li>
                        <li>Hue (often) shifts towards a luminosity maximum</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This will allow you to take one hue, but modify it endlessly for all your UI needs, using darker
                        and lighter variations where appropriate.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>I just whipped together a quick example here. A whole interface being built out of a single
                        color. Say… <em>does that shade of teal look familiar</em>?</p>
                    <p>Now I’ve been pretty brief with all of this. There are still many topics to cover:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How is <strong>hue</strong> even more important in <strong>gradients</strong> and <strong>data
                            visualization</strong>?
                        </li>
                        <li>When you’re in Sketch (etc.), what technique do you use to make <strong>darker
                            variations</strong>?
                        </li>
                        <li>Do you to <strong>move saturation or brightness more</strong>?</li>
                        <li>How do you find <strong>grays</strong> that match your color scheme?</li>
                        <li>How do you pick <strong>totally unrelated colors</strong> that look good together?</li>
                        <li>How do you fix it when colors <strong>clash</strong>?</li>
                        <li>And, of course, just why <em>are</em> RGB and CMY the low/high points on the luminosity
                            graph?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I’m glad you asked.</p>
